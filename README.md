# Tutedude-Assignment

I have created a form, where one can enter name, course, email of the student. After entering the details manually, and when they press Generate pdf, it should open a pdf 
with that name and course on the pdf. 

But here, it is not rendering the pdf, there is some unknown problem. I will try to fix it. But, I have almost completed Backend part, Frontend part too. 

I have integrated Google Drive API for uploading files and Mongodb for storing the model in database.

**How to run**:

1. git clone
2. cd certificate/
3. npm start
4. cd Backend
5. npx nodemon index.js
